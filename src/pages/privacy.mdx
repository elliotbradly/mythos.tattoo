# Fetching Live JSON Data

This page demonstrates how to fetch data from a live API endpoint and display it directly within an MDX file. The component below handles the loading state, error handling, and formatting of the JSON response.

We will use the JSONPlaceholder API for this example.

## Fetching a Single Post

Here is the data for post #1:

<JsonFetcher url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" />

## Fetching a List of Users

You can use the same component to fetch a different endpoint, like a list of users.

<JsonFetcher url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" />
