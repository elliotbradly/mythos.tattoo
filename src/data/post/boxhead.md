California Simulator: A Novel Outline
“California Simulator” follows Boxhead, a man fiercely guarding his morality in a relentlessly degrading California landscape. He’s a quiet observer, haunted by the pervasive “degeneration” surrounding him, and desperately saving to escape the state – and perhaps, himself – with a car. He avoids connection, fearing the corrupting influence of others, and actively avoids confrontation, knowing self-defense leads to imprisonment in a system that seems to favor chaos.
His daily life is a study in calculated avoidance. Uber drivers are unreliable, forcing him to walk, often towards the dispensaries that offer a temporary solace from the surrounding decay. These aren’t uniform havens; he navigates a tiered system of cannabis – small farms offering weaker, shorter-lived highs, versus the potent “farm cut” that lingers into the next day, a testament to the relentless pursuit of THC. He mixes high-THC strains with “Rose Queen” for a balanced experience, seeking a “nicer” high, a small act of control.
The novel explores the purpose of these dispensaries – are they escape, or merely a palliative for a deeper societal malaise? Boxhead’s world is populated by “riff raff” he actively avoids through ignoring, crossing streets, and sticking to populated areas. A silent rule governs his existence: don’t talk about “the box,” and never defend yourself.
He carries a Kimber 45 ACP, a last resort he desperately tries to avoid using. His background hints at a past understanding of systems, perhaps a social worker, giving him a cynical, informed perspective. The narrative draws parallels to Crime and Punishment, suggesting a moral struggle within a lawless environment, a modern “Sodome” where survival demands a constant negotiation with one’s own principles. The core tension lies in Boxhead’s pursuit of freedom – both physical and moral – in a state that seems determined to erode both.
